# EigenNET
## Independent. Efficient. Real C++ – Neural network without overhead

The purpose of the ***EigenNET project*** is to develop streamlined and highly efficient methods related to deep learning and make them available to the ML/DL community. The development tool for these methods is C/C++, and the methods are integrated into an R (Python, etc.) workflow so that complex pre- and post-processing steps do not burden the C/C++ methods. 

*To put it in a nutshell, oversized frameworks such as TensorFlow are not needed. The principle is: “Use the right tool for the work to be done!”*

Instead, it relies on the lean and precise *Eigen library* to perform linear algebra operations at lightning speed and with minimal memory usage.

The ***EigenNET project*** demonstrates how modern neural networks can be trained efficiently even in resource-constrained environments—ideal for embedded systems, scientific prototypes, or simply for anyone who loves C++ and wants or needs to avoid unnecessary overhead.

### EigenNET and R as Startegic Partner

Why the statistical environment ***R***? Because ML methods such as the following *Dense_NN C++ program*  trains the neural network efficiently and resource-conserving and ***R*** handles tasks related to data preparation and analysis - in line with a clear separation of responsibilities and capabilities.

Of course, other environments such as Python are also possible partners. It's all about using the right tool for the concrete task and exemplary workflows in R are of course presented here.

### Dense_NN, the first C++ program of the EigenNET project.

[**Dense_NN**](https://github.com/SuprenumDE/Dense_NN) is a compact, powerful C++ program for the efficient implementation and training of **dense networks**. 

### Features:
<ul>
<li>Dense network architecture with adjustable depth and activation functions</li>
<li>Eigen-based matrix operations for maximum speed</li>
<li>Minimal code footprint, maximum control</li>
<li>Ideal for demonstrations, teaching, and research</li>
</ul>
