# EigenNET
## Independent. Efficient. Real C++ – Neural network without overhead

### Dense_NN, the first C++ program of the EigenNET project.
**Dense_NN** is a compact, powerful C++ program for the efficient implementation and training of **dense networks** – without the need for typical *giant frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch*. Instead, it relies on the lean and precise *Eigen library* to perform linear algebra operations at lightning speed and with minimal memory usage.

The *EigenNET project* demonstrates how modern neural networks can be trained efficiently even in resource-constrained environments—ideal for embedded systems, scientific prototypes, or simply for anyone who loves C++ and wants or needs to avoid unnecessary overhead.

### Features:
<ul>
<li>Dense network architecture with adjustable depth and activation functions</li>
<li>Eigen-based matrix operations for maximum speed</li>
<li>Minimal code footprint, maximum control</li>
<li>Ideal for demonstrations, teaching, and research</li>
</ul>

### EigenNET and R as Startegic Partner
Why the statistical environment ***R***? While *Dense_NN* trains the neural network efficiently and resource-conserving in C++, ***R*** handles tasks related to data preparation and analysis - in line with a clear separation of responsibilities and capabilities.

Of course, other environments such as Python are also possible partners. It's all about using the right tool for the concrete task. 

### Here is an overview of what Dense_NN does
